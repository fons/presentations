# cl-mongo : A lisp interface to mongo

## Lightning Talk presented at mongonyc May 21 2010.

This is the material I used for the 10 minute [presentation](http://blip.tv/file/3680363) 
done at mongonyc on May 21 2010.

My original intent was to show the open-office presentation, but when I was at the conference 
I concluded that a demonstration was more appropriate. That presentation is the .lisp file in this directory.

I've exported the open office .odf formattedfile to powerpoint's .ppt format as well.
